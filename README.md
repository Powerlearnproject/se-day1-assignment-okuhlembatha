#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

As stated by Sommerville, software engineering is a discipline centered around developing cost-effective and high-quality software systems. According to my understanding it involves solving real-world problems by designing, developing , testing, deploying, and maintaining a software application that meets user requirements. 
Software engineering is essential because it ensures the development of reliable software that is safe to use, guarantees effectiveness by ensuring the system meets its requirements, and promotes cost-effective systems that are affordable and accessible to everyone. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The emergence of high-level language(1950s-1960s): Software development was ransformed with the emrgence of high-level programming languages including Frtran, COBOL, and LISP. Significant development included advanced languages that made coding more accessible, compilers and interpreters that convert high-level code into machine code, and the growing importance of business apps and database management systems.
2. Age of the internet(1990s-2000s): Software became a universal, integrated entity due to the World Wide Web. Significant development involved the intervention of the world wide web that made the software to be global and integrated entity, client-server architectre that intergrated web applications with by users through client-server architecture, and the creation of web browsers, like Netscap Navigator. e-commerce sites, like eBay and Amazon. Immediate chatting and email services.
3. The development of apps and mobile devices(2000s-Present): A new era of software creation was brought in by the widespread use of smartphones and app stores. The significant developments included mobile devices like smartphones and tablet, app stores that offer centralized distribution include Google Play and the Apple App Store, and mobile application are used for a range of functons such as navigation and social networking.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning: This step involves gathering information from users to help understand and define the project scope and set objectives and goals.
2. Requirement analysis: This step defines and document user and system requirements. Developers have discussions with stakeholders to ensure clarity and specify requirements that define functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
3. Designing: Create design system architecture, including UI/UX, database structure, and system elements. Document the designs using wireframe and software models.
4. Implementation: Develop the software by coding system based on the design specifications and selecting the suitable programminga language and frameworks to achieve the system requirements.
5. Testing: The software is tested through unit, integration, and system testing to ensure it meets the quality of the requirements specified and checks if the system has any flaws and fixes bugs.
6. Deployment and maintainance: Release the softawre to end-users and based on customer feedback maintain the software by improving, fixing bugs, and updating the system.   

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Waterfall methodology: It is a plan-driven model where processes are sequential. The inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct 
stages makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements. Testing is done at the end of the development. Example: Developing a flight control system.
2. Agile: It is iterative and highly flexible. Planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements. Testing is continuous throughout the development. Example: Developing a mobile app with frequent feature updates.  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software developer: They are responsible for designing, developing, testing, and implementing the software to satisfy the user ans system requirements. Their duty includes: Software design and architecture, coding and implementation, testing and debugging, and deployment and maintenance. 
2. Quality assurance engineer: They are responsible for discovering and fixing flaws in the system to enhance its perfoemance, security, and accuracy. Their duty includes requirement analysis, software testing, integration and deployment, and documentation and compliance.  
3. Project manager: People who must plan, motivate, organize, and control the practitioners who do software work. Their duty includes assigning task to individuals, perform formal risk management, estimating cost and schedule, and track the amount of work done, cost, and the remaining work. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs: They have amaizing functionality that allows the developer to write, test, and debug code efficiently. IDEs integrate several tools into one interface resulting into improved development. Example: Visual Studio Code(VS Code) and Android Studio.
2. VCS: VCS enables developers to work together effectively, maintain code versions to avoid data loss, and monitor changes. Example: Git and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
